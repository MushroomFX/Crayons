### **Info:**
- This program fetches random images that are tagged from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), which can lead to duplicates. The number of fetch requests grows non-linearly for higher numbers (e.g., 100 > 75; 1000 > 150).
- The time it takes to download is affected by Unsplash and can vary sometimes!
