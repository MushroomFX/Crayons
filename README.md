### **Insight:**
- This program fetches a captivating assortment of random images, each tagged with specific keywords, from the vast expanse of [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). While occasional duplicates are possible, it's important to note that the number of fetch requests doesn't scale linearly for higher quantities (e.g., 100 images require more requests than 75 images; 1000 images need more than 150 requests).
- The download duration can fluctuate due to factors associated with Unsplash's servers and network conditions. Please bear with any variations in download times.
- The **`images`** folder will be generated once the script is executed at least once!
